Infinite Color (2018), Jing’an, Shanghai.
Set within the sensory overload of a commercial department store, Infinite Color introduces a vivid, high-saturation space filled with playful interventions—a working toy claw machine, bursts of bubbles, rainbow lighting, and a digital spatio-temporal tunnel.
Rather than competing with its chaotic surroundings, the installation cuts through with unexpected clarity, inviting small moments of joy and curiosity.
