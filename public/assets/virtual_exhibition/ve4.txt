This work is based on a traumatic encounter with a dying stray kitten found on the side of the road. The kitten, only a few weeks old, had all four legs tightly bound with transparent tape. It had been left in a dirty delivery box, surrounded by flies—starving, silent, and barely alive.The kitten was taken to a veterinary clinic, but the injuries were too severe. Despite care, it passed away a few days later.

What’s most painful is that there was no way to find out who did this—no one to hold accountable. This work asks: how much malevolence can a human direct toward a fragile life? And when the source of cruelty remains faceless, how does one seek justice?
